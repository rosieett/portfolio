This site is not only my portfolio but a project in-and-of itself. I created this site after finishing the Front End Development class at General Assembly as a large html/css project. I'm in the process of rebuilding it using Vue because wow updating relative links manually is a hassle. 

## Front-End Web Development Examples

Examples of my work can be seen throughout for my print/static work, but code examples for how I created the interactive pieces within the WRI Data Vis page can be found [here for scrollytelling code](https://github.com/rosieett/rosieettenheim.com/tree/master/codeExamples/seagrassScrollytelling) and [here for interactive tables with tippy](https://github.com/rosieett/rosieettenheim.com/blob/master/codeExamples/tippy/index.html). A bigger project that I created is [The Muppet Study](https://github.com/rosieett/theMuppets) - the news component of it is under construction right now but the main Muppet sorter and infographics are still available for exploration!
